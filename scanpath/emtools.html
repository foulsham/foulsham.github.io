            <p> There are lots of different ways to look at and analyse data from complex eye movement experiments. In my research I have been particularly interested in comparing whole sequences of eye movements ("scanpaths") to see whether people are consistent in where, and when, they look.</p>
            <p> There are several different ways scanpaths can be compared, and I have written some programs to analyse this data and to plot eye movements.</p>
            <p> I've now bundled these programs together into "EMTools".  You can <a href=emtools.zip>download a zip file</a> of the source and class files for this program, and it should work on most operating systems, provided that Java is installed.</p>
            <p> There is a readme file for EMTools located <a href="../emtools_readme.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p> You can view an older, simpler version of one of the programs as a Java applet from within your browser <a href="scanpaths.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>You will now see a set of short comic strips like the ones you might see in a newspaper.</p>
  <p>Some of the images may have information missing, but your job is simply to read them and try to understand the story.</p>
  <p>You will see each panel one at a time. <b>When you've read each panel, press SPACE to continue. </b>
  <p>At the end of each strip we'll ask you how easy it was to understand the story.</p>
